# Introduction

## Project Background

Design an application template for a web application back-end which meets the
following criteria:

- First class support for data science.
- Fully asynchronous.
- Flexible architecture which able to adapt to change and scale.
- Initial support for 500-1000 concurrent users on modest hardware.
- Audit trail support.
- Time travel.
- Simple to test, debug, and maintain.

## Scope and Limitations

This project is limited to research within the fields of web applications, and
distributed systems only. Any related fields will not be included.

Research sources for this project include books, online articles, blog posts,
and non-academic software conference talks in addition to peer reviewed
materials. Software, and web applications in particular, is a rapid moving
field, and such much of the available peer-reviewed literature becomes outdated
soon after it is published. In order to access the most relevant information it
is thus essential that these sources are consulted.

It is assumed that the reader is reasonably well versed in traditional back-end
web development, and that terms such as threads, HTTP, asynchronous
communication, etc do not need to be explained.

It is further assumed that the reader is familiar with the technologies chosen
for implementation of this project, or that they are able to find tutorials or
books to teach them the basics. Due to the short time frame given for this
project, it is impossible to include a crash course in the technologies used, in
addition to the project itself. Information on all technology used in this
project is readily available for free from numerous online sources.

This project will be tested for performance, however the results should be taken
with a pinch of salt, given that it is very difficult to predict the performance
of a real world application built on top of this framework without actually
testing that exact application. Also time constraints have resulted in
performance testing being a minor concern, and a better test can certainly be
written.

Finally, the project includes an additional component, a web console for
interacting with the back-end, and testing it. This front-end application does
not form part of the scope of this project, and therefore it's implementation,
or any details surrounding it will not be discussed at all.
