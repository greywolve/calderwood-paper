abstract: Calderwood is a web application template designed for building
          applications that are architected for data science. Traditional
          Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) based web applications lose data,
          since they only store the newest state of the world. This makes data
          analysis after the fact tedious, as the information of interest is
          often sitting in obscure places, such as database logs. Research was
          done on Event Sourcing, CQRS (Command Query Responsibility
          Segregation), Datomic (an immutable database), among others, in order
          to come up with a solution. The project was successfully completed,
          and demonstrates how to build a web application which puts data
          analysis first, while exhibiting a flexible and maintainable
          architecture.
